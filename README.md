# Machine Learning Models with Supervised Learning

Welcome to my repository for learning Machine Learning models using supervised learning techniques! In this repository, I have implemented several supervised learning algorithms and provided example code, datasets, and visualizations for each. I also add some pictorial pictures for the reminding the concept of that algorithm.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Linear Regression:** Predicting numerical values based on linear relationships.
- **Multiple Linear Regression:** Extending linear regression to handle multiple input features.
- **Decision Trees:** Building decision trees for classification and regression tasks.

## Contents of Each Model's Directory

Each model directory includes the following files and resources:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** Explore the step-by-step implementation of the algorithm with explanations and code examples.
- **Dataset:** Sample datasets used for training and evaluation.

## Model Descriptions and Benefits

### Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm used for predicting numerical values based on linear relationships between input variables and the target variable. By fitting a line to the data points, it can make predictions on new data and uncover the underlying trends and patterns.

### Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression extends the concept of linear regression by considering multiple input features to predict a numerical output. It captures the relationships between several independent variables and the dependent variable, allowing for more complex and accurate predictions.

### Decision Trees

Decision trees are powerful and interpretable models used for both classification and regression tasks. They build a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. Decision trees are widely used due to their simplicity, ability to handle both numerical and categorical data, and the intuitive nature of the resulting tree structure.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. Navigate to the specific model's directory that you are interested in.

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`.ipynb`) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Follow along with the code, explanations, and visualizations to gain an understanding of the implementation and experiment with different parameters and datasets.

Feel free to explore, learn, and experiment with the code in this repository. Happy machine learning!
